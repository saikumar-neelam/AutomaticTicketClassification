After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply.

On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full. The payment was no process with my bank until XX/XX/XXXX because the due date was over the weekend. Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law. I received the statement on XX/XX/XXXX when the bill was due on XX/XX/XXXX.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place.

The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full.

Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full. The payment was no process with my bank until XX/XX/XXXX because the due date was over the weekend. Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place. Whether is mail or online this should apply. The credit card law of XX/XX/XXXX section 106 ( a ) 2 and section 163 ( a ) and ( b ) which they credit card company did not mail me the statement within 21 days to the due date as require by Law.

After my mother died in  XX/XX/XXXX  and inherited her home I made several attempts to have my name added to the loan to continue the monthly loan payments without any success. On  XX/XX/XXXX  the bank performed a lockout before it had legal ownership of the property. My mothers property was compromised and the bank offered no relief. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I made application with the bank to have my name added to the loan. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I was informed by the bank that I did n't qualify to have my name added to the loan because I was not residing in the home at the time I made application. How can I prepare the home to reside in or sell when the bank had locked me out before it had legal ownership of the house? I recently gained entry into the house and found that the house was in need of repairs before I could move into the home or sell the home to pay off the note and save my equity that I inherited. I have also reapplied for loan assistance with the bank loss mitigation department in an attempt to qualify to reside in the home and at the same time listed the home for sale sell to payoff the loan. I have an offer on the home to sell that is being negotiated at this time. I have also included an approved Florida Supreme Court form that gives reasons why the foreclosure sale should be canceled for  XX/XX/XXXX . Because of the difficulties I have had with the bank in assisting me with the home I inherited after my mothers death I believe that the bank has engaged in unfair and unsound banking practices that are offensive and contrary to Florida public policy. I request that the foreclosure sale for  XX/XX/XXXX  be canceled and given a fair opportunity to reside or at the same time negotiate a sale of the house that I inherited to save my inherited equity.\",\n          \"My bank keeps charging me fees of {$34.00} and it is becoming too much, if the money is not there they should just bounce the check, or take it from another account as I thought that is what we agreed to do.\",\n          \"I pay off my balance due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which it was a weekend but they claim if was after they cuff off and charge me interest even that it was paid on time and in full. The payment was no process with my bank until XX/XX/XXXX because the due date was over the weekend. Whether is mail or online the laws says that we have 21 until the due date for the credit card to received payment and if the payment is over the weekend there is a grace period until the next business day. The law of credit card act does not specified any time cutoff for weekend payment only for business day. if payment is received within the 21 days and fall in a weekend a grace period will be in place.
